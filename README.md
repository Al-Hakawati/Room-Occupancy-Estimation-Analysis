# Room Occupancy Estimation Analysis
## Introduction
I have tackled the room occupancy estimation problem to optimize energy usage. The dataset comprises sensor data from various sources like temperature and CO2 levels. The goal is to predict room occupancy counts.

## Methods
I have employed Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost algorithms. Testing involves k-fold cross-validation. These algorithms excel in handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex patterns.

## Evaluation
I have evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R2 Score. Gradient Boosting and XGBoost outperform others, showing balanced performance without overfitting.

## Results and Discussion
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost perform best due to their ability to capture complex relationships. Future enhancements include advanced feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization.
